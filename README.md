Treehouse Techdegree Project 6: Game Show App

The goal of this project was to create a browser version of "Wheel of Success", a word-guessing game where players click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. Like hangman, players have a limited amount of chances to guess the correct letters.

The basic requirements of this project included: creating an array of phrases; creating functions to choose a random phrase from the array, split phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board; updating game board with letter if chosen letter is in the phrase; displaying the 5 guess chances on the screen and updating when an incorrect guess is made; displaying a winning screen overlay if player completes phrase before running out of guesses OR displaying a losing screen overlay if the player guesses incorrectly 5 times; disabling a letter after it's chosen so that a player is only able to guess a letter once.

The extra credit requirements of this project included: creating CSS transitions for each letter in the phrase display as they are revealed; adding a button to the 'success' and 'failure' screens that reset the game--recreating keyboard buttons, generating a new random phrase, and set the number of wrong guesses back to 0.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by: adding 19 fun phrases to my random phrases array (8 phrases required); coding my program to ensure that a new phrase is displayed each time the game is reset, so that the same phrase is never displayed twice in a row; rather than fixing a text-wrap issue that was causing my long phrases to display improperly by simply using only shorter phrases, tackling the issue by doing extra work in order to fix the problem and keep my original and awesome phrase array with varying degrees of length (and difficulty).
